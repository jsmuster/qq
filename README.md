## Architecture Overview

An Isomorphic application is the combination of techniques in a server-rendered application and a single-page application.

# SEO out of the box
Isomorphic apps employ a pattern that exploits storing data locally and minimizing server requests. The apps render flawlessly, maximize SEO, and offer opportunities to share code and libraries between client and server.
